# ZARFUEL Forum Tables Fix

This document provides instructions for fixing issues with the forum functionality in the ZARFUEL Project Compass application.

## Issue Description

The forum functionality has been experiencing several issues:

1. Posts and comments disappearing after page refresh
2. Error messages about schema cache not finding columns like "likes" or "parent_comment_id"
3. Failed like/dislike functionality for comments
4. Comment replies not working properly
5. Notifications not being sent to all users for all activities

## Fix Solution

We've implemented a comprehensive fix that resolves all these issues by:

1. Fixing the database schema for forum tables
2. Improving the data fetching logic
3. Enhancing the notification system
4. Fixing the like/dislike functionality for both posts and comments
5. Properly implementing comment replies

## Fix Implementation Options

### Option 1: Run SQL in Supabase Studio (Recommended)

This is the most reliable option as it directly fixes the database schema:

1. Log in to your Supabase project at https://app.supabase.com
2. Open the SQL Editor
3. Copy the contents of the `supabase/fix-forum-tables.sql` file and paste it into the SQL Editor
4. Run the SQL script
5. Restart your application

### Option 2: Update Your Code

We've made several improvements to the codebase:

1. Enhanced schema refresh function in `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`
2. Fixed like/dislike handling in `src/pages/ForumPage.tsx`
3. Properly implemented comment replies
4. Improved notification system to notify all users

After pulling these changes, restart your development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Specific Fixes Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Fixes

- Fixed the `likes` column to properly use JSONB type with default empty array
- Improved foreign key relationship between `forum_comments` and `parent_comment_id`
- Added proper indexes for performance
- Updated RLS policies to allow proper access for liking/disliking

### 2. Code Fixes

- Enhanced error handling for likes/dislikes
- Improved comment reply functionality
- Better notification system to notify all users
- More robust schema refresh to prevent cache issues

### 3. Notification System

The notification system now properly informs:
- Post authors when someone likes or comments on their post
- Comment authors when someone likes or replies to their comment
- All other users about new posts, comments, and activity

## Troubleshooting

If you continue to experience issues after applying these fixes:

1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Run the SQL fix script again to ensure the database schema is correct
3. Clear your browser cache and local storage
4. Try using the application in incognito/private browsing mode
5. Verify that all tables have been properly created in Supabase
6. Try using the schema refresh function in the browser console:
   ```javascript
   await window.refreshSchema()
   ```

## Additional Notes

- The `mentioned_users` feature has been removed as it was causing issues
- Comment replies are now fully functional
- Like/dislike functionality works for both posts and comments
- All users now receive notifications for all forum activities
